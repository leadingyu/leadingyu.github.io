**We are the ultimate risk-takers.**
We walk the road where life is staked for eternity.

For the living — we stand between them and the shadow of perishing,
and we will wager our breath to keep their flame alight.

For the dead — we defy the silence,
and we will wager our breath to wrest them from the grip of death itself.
